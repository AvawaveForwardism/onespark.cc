			<p class="headingText"><b>The Review</b></p>
          <p>So then, what are my thought on "Soviet Democracy" by Pat Sloan? Well I would say it is generally a good introductory read as it repudiates many of the lies and misconceptions perpetuated of the USSR. But I think going beyond that point marxists should hold a bit more of a critical stance of this work. Tho yes generally good it contains some flaws. My main issue stems from the texts praise of the soviet proletarian mode of governance as merely a superior mode of state society, but we as marxists should know that in the end the goal is a stateless, moneyless, and classless society. Pat I think doesn't do a sufficient job of emphasizing this fact which I think should be crucial for an introductory text. Which I think could very well be due to Pat not sufficiently grasping the purpose and aims of the soviet government. He threw  a few quotes of Marx and Lenin around but I don't think he was really a Marxist-Leninist rather just exposed to their ideas as a consequence of living within the soviet union for a few years. And in fact this was my introductory text being the first physically book on socialism I have read in full. I was intially dazzled by the Soviet society as described by Pat. But as I have come to read and learn more I have shifted towards a more critical stance of the Soviet Union from a forwardist not leftcom perspective. Looking past my critiques of the pre-revisionist USSR however, this book is reccomended rather frequently I think as an introductory text. I know youtubers such as LadyIzdihar and Hakim have reccomended this work in the past which is the entire reason why I bought it in the first place. And really upon further investigation of the works reccomended by Hakim it really begins to bring up the question of his ideological standing given the works he's reccomending. But anyway back to the point, the book is a good introductory text for those, particularly in the West and anti-communist countries, as it wonderfully repudiates the cold war and second red scare lies which are so often perpetuated about the USSR and Stalin. Going beyond that tho, those baby marxists should be directed in a positive direction with a healthy list of reading reccomendations, as opposed to the revisionist slop which dominates youtube and other so called "marxist" spaces, in order for them to come to the correct understandings of the Soviet Union beyond intial dogmatic praise of it. And by understanding the soviet union it enables them to better formulate a conception of what a proletarian state will look like after the revolutionary seizure of power learning from both the mistakes and many successes of the bolsheviks in their revolutionary movement. We all must continue on to struggle against incorrect ideas and seek the truth from the fact! so jar! :3</p>
