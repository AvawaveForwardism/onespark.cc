			<p class="writingsTitleText"><b>Thoughts and Takeaways from Mao’s <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-9/mswv9_01.htm">“Where Do Correct Ideas Come From”</a></b><p>
			
			<p class="headingText"><b>Main Focus in Study</b></p>
				<p>When I read the communist manifesto a few weeks ago and published my thoughts on it my analysis of the text, at least the part written in full paragraphs, it was mainly focused on one subject, that being the question of revolution in the “backward” countries. Similarly in my analysis of this text my mind was mainly occupied by one question, that being <i>how does the dialectical materialist understanding of the development of ideas relate to my process and understanding of development ideas and plans in my transition.</i> Thus I will be including this section clarifying my main focus in my study of a text at the beginning of these articles going forward as a means of giving clarity to my analysis and motivations. When studying marxists works we should have a purpose in mind, Marx famously said </p>
				<p><i>“The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point is to change it.” </i></p>
				<p>This being related to this text as well as Mao states something similar, I imagine in reference to the Marx quote. The purpose of the acquisition of knowledge is to use it in some way, to paraphrase very roughly what he said. The whole addition of this section too is related to the text at hand <i>but I will leave that as an exercise to the reader </i>(that is to say I encourage you to read the text if you haven’t before or need a refresher).</p>
			


      <p class="headingText"><b>Thoughts</b></p>
				<p>I haven’t read, listened, to this text before and apparently I didn’t even know the length. I think I had mistaken it for a different text and thought it would be longer, silly me. Anyway it is a very short text, as in only about a paragraph long, but is extracted from a longer document. In short it is similar to Mao’s longer work “on practice” and discusses how, and where correct ideas come from. Mao states that in the process of cognition there are 2 stages, firstly the acquisition of perceptual knowledge (gaining experience) and doing so to a sufficient degree to which perceptual knowledge (experience) makes a qualitative leap to become conceptual knowledge (ideas), then secondly the testing of these ideas thru social practice (that is to say experimentation or application to the material world) and in this stage an idea (theory, plan, policy, etc) is proven to either be correct or incorrect. I understood this as forming a loop of sorts as the second stage of this process generates experience from which can generate new ideas and so repeat the process. From this evaluation it can be said that that in order to find the path to victory one must take part in this method of gaining experience, formulating ideas, and testing formulated ideas.</p>
				<p>I claim this as I’ve engaged in this process as well in my transition. Not that many days ago as of writing I took a trip to London, of particular importance was the fact that I took the trip alone. Typically I am accustomed to following a family member around rather than charting my own course so to speak. Consequently I was engaging in a brand new experience of actually taking part in determining my fate, getting to decide what I do at any given moment essentially in full. I consequently had a few struggles but of interest was the experiences I gained. After that trip I concluded that I had aquired such an immense amount of experience that I should write them down to elaborate on them and conjure up new ideas. That was the whole point of that trip to gain experience learn from existing ideas I had and refine them. I followed the process as described by Mao in the text and took part in an exercise in marxist theory, tho I did not exactly phrase it that way in my justifications and thinking the logic was thoroughly marxist.</p>
				<p>I of course recognize that Mao writes about these things precisely because he has the experience, direct and indirect, which validates and reinforces this worldview. My own direct experience helped me further understand this as well. That is the best way to understand theory afterall, practice as is emphasized by this text.</p>
			
			<p class="headingText"><b>Takeaways For Marxism</b></p>
        <p style=" text-align: left;">-	The correctness of an idea, theory, policy, etc, can only be determined by testing it, that is to say engaging in social practice.</p>
				<p style=" text-align: left;">-	All ideas necessary emerge from preceptual knowledge, that is to say all ideas and knowledge come from direct experience.</p>
			

			<p class="headingText"><b>Takeaways For Transition</b></p>
				<p style=" text-align: left;">-	The first step to success in transition is taking action, action should be placed at the forefront of the struggle for transition. Without action there can’t be victory.</p>
				<p style=" text-align: left;">-	When taking actions to advance transition one must keep in mind and recognize that ideas emerge from experience and that correct ideas can only be proven thru testing. </p>


			<p class="headingText"><b>Quote</b></p>
			  <p><i><b>“Where do correct ideas come from? Do they drop from the skies? No. Are they innate in the mind? No. They come from social practice, and from it alone;”</b></i></p>



      <p class="headingText"><b>CRITICISMS</b></p>
			  <p id="criticismsText">All critiques can be directed to my email (AvawaveForward@proton.me) or my twitter (@AvawaveMaoism). I accept criticisms from all well meaning and serious people, only through struggle can higher understanding be developed.</p>
