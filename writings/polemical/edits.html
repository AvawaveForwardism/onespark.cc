			<p class="writingsTitleText"><b>Current Title: "How to Make a Good Edit, Politically and Stylisitcally"</b><p>
			
	            <p class="headingText"><b>Subject 1 - "My Main Gripes with Most Edits - Against the TikTok Style"</b></p>
                    <p>Here I will explain my main issues with different kinds of edits, namely those popular, and popularized, by TikTok. In the outline I wrote:</p>
                    <p>"explaining my main gripes with most edits, paying main attention to the tiktok style and highlighting what is wrong with it, namely
        <br>1 - fascist symbology<br>
        2 - over emphasis of leaders and ignorance of the masses<br>
        3 - fascist styling (music selection)<br>
        4 - emergent poor political message<br>
        5 - giving a nod to how it is stylisitcally solid"</p>

                <p class="headingText"><b>Subject 2 - "Bad and Good Examples"</b></p>
                    <p>Basically jut providing a list of bad then good examples of edits and explaining each edit's good and bad qualities, and why I marked them as good or bad.</p>

                <p class="headingText"><b>Subject 3 - "How I Think it Should Be Done"</b></p>
                    <p>In this part I intend on explaining how I think edits should be made, based on the arguments and examples given above. In the outline I wrote:</p>
                    <p>"expounding on how I think edits should be made and how there should be attention paid to the song used, kind of song used, symbols used, mesage conveyed, editing style, and political content within the edit"</p>

                <p class="headingText"><b>Misc Notes</b></p>
                    <p>To the uninitiated this probably seems like an odd thing to write about but I was spurred on to draft this firstly because my disdain for TikTok communists and their edits, and editing style, but also because of an interaction I had with @bokiimokii on twitter / @bokiimoderv2 on tiktok in regards to the edits they make/have made which compelled me to write a more extensive and comprehensive guide on the subject.</p>

      <p class="headingText"><b>CRITICISMS AND SUGGESTIONS</b></p>
			  <p id="criticismsText">All critiques and suggestions can be directed to my email (AvawaveForward@proton.me) or my twitter (@AvawaveMaoism). I accept criticisms from all well meaning and serious people, only through struggle can higher understanding be developed.</p>
