			<p class="writingsTitleText"><b>Current Title: "Where is Azania?"</b><p>
			
	            <p class="headingText"><b>Subject 1 - "Is Azania South or East African?"</b></p>
                    <p>Here I will repudiate the South African claims to the name "Azania" based on historical evidence and logic and instead defend that "Azania" is a name which belongs and denotes east not south Africa. In the outline I wrote:</p>
                    <p>"explaining the ridiculousness of the attempt by South Africans to take claim of the Azanian civilization which was in *east* Africa not south. and providing alternatives to what they should rename their country."</p>

                <p class="headingText"><b>Subject 2 - "The Geographical Extent of Azania"</b></p>
                    <p>Here I intend define the geographical boundaries of Azania based on a few criterea namely, spread of swahili, historical connections, and on the ground realities. In the outline I wrote:</p>
                    <p>"justifying that azania should be the term which should apply to wider east africa given the historical contexts of the spread of swahili, and so too the vague associations of azania, and the modern movement for the unification of east africa. also justifying why this movement should be supported for the unification of the east african nationalities previously divided by colonialism under one banner."</p>

                <p class="headingText"><b>Misc Notes</b></p>
                    <p>I mainly decided to draft up this polemic for 2 reasons: 1) to repudiate the South Africans who still cling on to the name Azania; and 2) give a solid definition of the geographical boundaries of Azania given that, due to the expansion of the EAC, spread of Swahili, overlapping ethinicities, among other factors, has become rather blurry. I thus wish to at least attempt at giving more definite boundaries to the nation.</p>

      <p class="headingText"><b>CRITICISMS AND SUGGESTIONS</b></p>
