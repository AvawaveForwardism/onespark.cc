			<p class="writingsTitleText"><b>Current Title: "Against The Straw Man - In Defense of Genuine Marxism-Leninism-Maoism and Against Phoeny Deviations"</b><p>
			
	            <p class="headingText"><b>Subject 1 - "The Straw Man"</b></p>
                    <p>Introducing the problem of discussion in this document, that is the problem of most people not understanding maoism and consequently having a poor political line and people attacking it based on things it doesn't uphold due to having a shallow understanding. In the outline document I wrote:</p>
                    <p>"talking abt the problem of people attacking or even upholding maoism while having little understanding of what it is or who our global forces are, and as a result holding revisionist positions or attacking maoism based on half understood arguments which maoism may not even uphold at all."</p>

                <p class="headingText"><b>Subject 2 - "Internet "Maoism" and Internet "Communists""</b></p>
                    <p>Explaining, and attacking, the tendency of maoists online, or <i>"internet maoists"</i>, to not do nearly enough reading alongside doing no praxis whatsoever and having emergent poor lines or understandings generally. In the outline I wrote:</p>
                    <p>"attacking the tendency of online "maoists" and "communists" more broadly to do little reading and even less action, and demanding they do literally anything. also attacking ideology shopping"</p>

                <p class="headingText"><b>Subject 3 - "Attacking Figments of Imagination"</b></p>
                    <p>Critiquing the tendency of non-Marxist-Leninist-Maoists to attack maoism based on half understood positions. In the outline I wrote:</p>
                    <p>"based on the first section critiquing the tendency of essentially all revisionists to attack maoism based on flimsy or non-existent foundations and attacking hoxhaism specifically as a notable offender of this"</p>

                <p class="headingText"><b>Subject 4 - "The Correct Line"</b></p>
                    <p>Detailing what <i>"internet maoists"</i> should be doing instead to rectify their unsatisfactory state. In the outline I wrote:</p>
                    <p>"elaborating on the correct line maoists should hold in regard to theory and practice and what one should do to rectify a state of inaction. and also addressing certain points which maoism is attacked on, that is defending maoism."</p>

                <p class="headingText"><b>Misc Notes</b></p>
                    <p>This document is pretty self explanatory, it is a defense of maoism and through it I hope to get some other internet maoists, I am one myself at the end of the day, to rectify their unsatisfactory state. And of course to rebuttal some tired claims people throw around all the time without understanding maoism to any significant degree.</p>

      <p class="headingText"><b>CRITICISMS AND SUGGESTIONS</b></p>
			  <p id="criticismsText">All critiques and suggestions can be directed to my email (AvawaveForward@proton.me) or my twitter (@AvawaveMaoism). I accept criticisms from all well meaning and serious people, only through struggle can higher understanding be developed.</p>
