	            <p class="headingText"><b>Subject 1 - "[unsure rn]"</b></p>
                    <p>I don't really have much to write in terms of what is planned at the moment, this was more of a conceptual document I cooked up based on a question I had while <i>listening</i> to the <a href="https://www.bannedthought.net/USA/RCP/Books/MaoistEconomics-ShanghaiTextbook-Lotta-OCR-sm.pdf">Shanghai Textbook</a>(which I reccommend everyone to read!!). Specifically in relation to the general motif of "people not things" being decisive. There was something said within it that peaked my interest in relation to computerization. In the outline I wrote:</p>
                    <p>"my thoughts on this subject were spurred on by some quotes in the shanghai textbook that seemed to emphasize people in production a bit more than you'd expect and so limits automation (very rough interpretation) so, I was thinking abt how computerization of economic planning would look like and if there are any examples of this."</p>

                <p class="headingText"><b>Misc Notes</b></p>
                    <p>Everything of note as of now was already given above.</p>

      <p class="headingText"><b>CRITICISMS AND SUGGESTIONS</b></p>
			  <p id="criticismsText">All critiques and suggestions can be directed to my email (AvawaveForward@proton.me) or my twitter (@AvawaveMaoism). I accept criticisms from all well meaning and serious people, only through struggle can higher understanding be developed.</p>
