			<p class="writingsTitleText"><b>Current Title: "An Analysis of HRT Labs and DIY - A MARXIST Perspective Against Petite Bourgeois Anarchist Foolishness" <i>(very much not final)</i></b><p>
			
	            <p class="headingText"><b>Subject 1 - "Preamble"</b></p>
                    <p>This section would the introduction, which I'm presuming would need to be a bit thorough, to the document. Introducing the subjects of discussion and justification for writing. In the outline document I wrote:</p>
                    <p>"introducing the dissertation which prompted me to begin writing this part take down part informational article. offering an intial repudiation of the ideas of the dissertation, it's petite bourgeois, invidualist, anarchist, and post-modernist outlook, and a marxist outlook on the subject, emphasizing the necessity of marxists to provide opinions on all things and highlighting the dominance of bourgeois ideology on questions relating to trans people, their existence, and experiences. secondly talking abt hrt labs and providing a general marxist analysis of them, their class character, their work, and whether they are good or bad (argue they are good probably but y'know do investigation  first)"</p>
                    <p>Pls note, these are very preliminary arguments and will definetely be subject to change and refinement later.</p>

                <p class="headingText"><b>Subject 2 - Document Contents</b></p>
                    <p>The exact contents of the document are in contension as I need to do more research, namely fully and properly read the dissertation which I am intending to critique, and conduct research on the other points of discussion which I am intending to include in this document.</p>


                <p class="headingText"><b>Misc Notes</b></p>
                    <p>For context what is spurring me on to write this document was <a href="https://repository.arizona.edu/handle/10150/675301">this</a> dissertation. The author utilizes anarchism to analyze the trans phenomenon of DIYing our healthcare. For obvious reasons this peaked my interest and after a brief skimming of it was determined to write a rebuttal to their arguments from a Marxist-Leninist-Maoist perspective. This is a dissertation however and it is a bit long (174 pages) consequently this sits squarely at the bottom of my writting priority list and completing this rebuttal will take a long time. I think this is a very important topic however, and so I will try my hardest to provide an adequate counter position on this subject as soon as I can.</p>

      <p class="headingText"><b>CRITICISMS AND SUGGESTIONS</b></p>
			  <p id="criticismsText">All critiques and suggestions can be directed to my email (AvawaveForward@proton.me) or my twitter (@AvawaveMaoism). I accept criticisms from all well meaning and serious people, only through struggle can higher understanding be developed.</p>
