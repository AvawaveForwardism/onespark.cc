			<p class="writingsTitleText"><b>Current Title: "HRT Under Socialism"</b><p>
			
	            <p class="headingText"><b>Subject 1 - "HRT Under Capitalism"</b></p>
                    <p>Before I write anything conclusive on this subject I will have to conduct more researh as I'm not the most knowledgable on this subject, but I will essentially discuss: "how hrt is attained by trans people under capitalism, currently. the 2/4 methods which exist (conventional, and diy (hrt labs, pharmaceuticals, and majority stack diy)) and the difficulties with each of them."</p>

                <p class="headingText"><b>Subject 2 - "How (Medical) Production was Planned Under Socialism"</b></p>
                    <p>Here I will write a description of: "describing how medical and general production was planned under socialism before and what it is likely to look like in the future".</p>
                    <p>Also for this I will need to conduct more reasearch as I'm not the most knowledgeable on poilitical economy and economic planning. Aside from general research I intend to also refer largely to the Shanghai textbook, but how much I do that depends on how the researching pans out.</p>

                <p class="headingText"><b>Subject 3 - "HRT Under Socialism"</b></p>
                    <p>This will basically be a summation of the research and argumentation provided above based on particular questions.</p>
                    <p>What I wrote in the outline document for this section was: "describing what the experince of attaining hrt may look like under socialism and the overall production process of it may be like and explaining why it would be superior to the current system."</p>


                <p class="headingText"><b>Misc Notes</b></p>
                    <p>Overall this is one of the more beefy and thorough going documents I have planned, due to the amount of research it would require, consequently don't expect it to come out anytime soon. I may update this draft periodically with more info or resources as its construction comes along.</p>

      <p class="headingText"><b>CRITICISMS AND SUGGESTIONS</b></p>
			  <p id="criticismsText">All critiques and suggestions can be directed to my email (AvawaveForward@proton.me) or my twitter (@AvawaveMaoism). I accept criticisms from all well meaning and serious people, only through struggle can higher understanding be developed.</p>
