	            <p class="headingText"><b>Subject 1 - "Introduction to the Introduction"</b></p>
                    <p>This part is pretty self explanatory. It is the introduction to this document which is the introduction to this series overall. Basically a small intro to the topics and purpose of the series before the full introduction in the rest of this document.</p>

                <p class="headingText"><b>Subject 2 - "A Dire and Dangerous Situation"</b></p>
                    <p>A description of the precarity of transition which necessitates strong principles and solid world outlook. In the outline I wrote:</p>
                    <p>"talking abt the precarity of transition and the accompanying dangers and so the emergent reasoning why the application of marxism-leninism-maoism is most useful in transition, especially those which find themselves in especially dangerous and hostile environments."</p>

                <p class="headingText"><b>Subject 3 - "Potency"</b></p>
                    <p>An explanation of the potency and utility of marxism-leninism-maoism generally and particularly in regards to transition. In the outline I wrote:</p>
                    <p>"talk abt how marxism-leninism-maoism is a potent tool in understanding the processes and contradictions which transpire thru the process of one's transition, and given it being a scienttific worldview, provides an incredibly potent framework for navigating difficulties and important matters of transition. mention how the utilization of marxism-leninism-maoism is mainly harm reduction as many people have transitioned without it as a guide. and also of course mention how marxism-leninism-maoism has been steeled in the most dangerous of struggles and so offers an incredibly robust outlook on navigating problems both easy and hard."</p>

                <p class="headingText"><b>Subject 4 - "My Personal Conviction"</b></p>
                    <p>A decsription of my personal conviction in writing this series, and by proxy everything else on onespark.cc. In the outline I wrote:</p>
                    <p>"basically just mentioning how I see it as my duty to sharpen others transitions, mentioning how transition is what galvinized me to become a communist, and how I ultimately wish to see a better world for all people which is thus the framework I proceed in these writitings for the betterment of all people's, particularly trans people, and the improvement of other's life."</p>

                <p class="headingText"><b>Misc Notes</b></p>
                    <p>This is, obviously, the introductory text for this series and here I intend to touch upon some basic orientation to this subject and perspective.</p>

      <p class="headingText"><b>CRITICISMS AND SUGGESTIONS</b></p>
			  <p id="criticismsText">All critiques and suggestions can be directed to my email (AvawaveForward@proton.me) or my twitter (@AvawaveMaoism). I accept criticisms from all well meaning and serious people, only through struggle can higher understanding be developed.</p>
