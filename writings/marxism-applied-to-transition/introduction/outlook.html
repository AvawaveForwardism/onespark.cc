			<p class="writingsTitleText"><b>Current Title: "The General Outlook and Process"</b><p>
			
	            <p class="headingText"><b>Subject 1 - "How I Got Here"</b></p>
                    <p>Here I will write a summation of the process which lead me to my current gender identifcation, and explaining the whinding process which lead to it. In the outline document I wrote:</p>
                    <p>"briefly summarizing my process to recognizing myself as a trans woman, becoming a student of marxism-leninism-maoism, and putting marxism-leninism-maoism and transition together."</p>

                <p class="headingText"><b>Subject 2 - "The Final Goal"</b></p>
                    <p>A description of what my ultimate goal in transition is, and why I have this as my final goal. In the outline document I wrote:</p>
                    <p>"exlaining how the construction of myself as a woman without quotation marks and joining the struggle for the abolishment of class society are my 2 ultimate goals, necessitating first a struggle mainly on personal-individual matters and finally a struggle for wider social matters."</p>

                <p class="headingText"><b>Subject 3 - "Key Points of Struggle"</b></p>
                    <p>Explanation of the 3 key points of struggling against the boymode, and providing justifications for why these 3 are the main points of struggle. In the outline document I wrote:</p>
                    <p>"describing the main points on which I struggle against the boymode as being:<br>
        1 - material:<br>
            1/endocrinological//chemical - <br>
            2/the voice - <br>
            3/social - <br>
            4/appearance - <br>
            5/clothing - <br>

        2 - immaterial (mental):<br>
            1/self preception - <br>
            2/mannerisms - 
            3/<br>
        
        3 - academic/productive:<br>
            1/production speed -<br> 
            2/production volume - " (all I have thus far(this looked better on the outline doc))</p>

                <p class="headingText"><b>Subject 4 - "The Upheld Outlook"</b></p>
                    <p>Giving an overall description of the principles of the struggle to annihilate the boymode and succeed in transition. A description of the general laws and path of transition, and most of all, the general outlook to uphold. In the outline doc I wrote:</p>
                    <p>"describing the general outlook I have on the struggle to annihilate the boymode, the general path I predict it to follow and it's general laws. namely being against suicide, recognizing a whinding road, rejecting finality, and opposing the boymoderist tendency"</p>

                <p class="headingText"><b>Misc Notes</b></p>
                    <p>Compared to the length of the other documents in this part of the series, this document is, just by subjects but also intended length, the longest. The reason for this is that this is intended to be the master doc for this part of this series while the other 3 docs mainly serve as background to understanding and better grasp the contents of this document.</p>

      <p class="headingText"><b>CRITICISMS AND SUGGESTIONS</b></p>
			  <p id="criticismsText">All critiques and suggestions can be directed to my email (AvawaveForward@proton.me) or my twitter (@AvawaveMaoism). I accept criticisms from all well meaning and serious people, only through struggle can higher understanding be developed.</p>
