			<p class="writingsTitleText"><b>Current Title: "My Experience With Boymoding"</b><p>
			
	            <p class="headingText"><b>Subject 1 - "Nothing but Humiliation and Sujugation"</b></p>
                    <p>There's nothing really to add on for these personal writings so I'll just put what I wrote in the outline docs:</p>
                    <p>"talking abt how the boymode for me has been forever characterized by the complete subjugation to the will of others, social ineptitude, and constant social humiliation"</p>

                <p class="headingText"><b>Subject 2 - "Something Wholly Reactionary"</b></p>
                    <p>"talking about how the boymode for me can be compared to bureaucrat-capitalism and is maintained in service of my maintained subjugation to others and continued perpetuation of the reactionary patriarchal-capitalism. thus it is something reactionary and holds back progress, self flourishment, and my ability to stand with the rest of humanity as an equal in the great struggle for the complete emancipation of all oppressed people (by way of fomenting social antagonism between me and others as a result of incorrect social perception)"</p>

                <p class="headingText"><b>Subject 3 - "Bound for Annhilation from the Start"</b></p>
                    <p>"talking about how due to my initial tendecy and affinity toward femininity and my inevitable putting up of a struggle against the imposition of masculinization, the struggle against, and ultimately for the annihilation of, the boymode was always bound to occur especiallly in the modern day, and so I now carry forth this struggle based on the points generally described within the article"</p>

                <p class="headingText"><b>Misc Notes</b></p>
                    <p>I don't have much to add for this document, but essentially it is an extension to my "marxism applied to transition" series particularly on the question of boymoding. I want to give a more thorough going analysis of my experience here in this seperate document than I was intending to give in the main series.</p>

      <p class="headingText"><b>CRITICISMS AND SUGGESTIONS</b></p>
			  <p id="criticismsText">All critiques and suggestions can be directed to my email (AvawaveForward@proton.me) or my twitter (@AvawaveMaoism). I accept criticisms from all well meaning and serious people, only through struggle can higher understanding be developed.</p>
