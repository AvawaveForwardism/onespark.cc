			<p class="writingsTitleText"><b>Current Title: "Why I Never Became A Leftcom"</b><p>
			
	            <p class="headingText"><b>Subject 1 - "A Brief Explanation of "Left Communism" Online"</b></p>
                    <p>Another personal doc so here's what I wrote in the outline:</p>
                    <p>"explaining the phenomenon of leftcommunism online, namely its recent rise in "popularity" and their online ragebait, gaslight, indoctrinate, strategy of converting people to their world outlook. also giving note to the socially repulsive and/or reactionary character of many leftcoms. also mentioning the historical prevelance of maoism online rather than this dogmato-ultra-leftism"</p>

                <p class="headingText"><b>Subject 2 - "My History with Marxism and My Near Miss with Left Communism"</b></p>
                    <p>"expounding on my near miss with left communism when I was really beginning to read theory and study stalin back in fall 2024 and how in this process, mainly through the critique of stalin and his policies, I was greatly influenced and nearly swayed to at least partial sympathy toward leftcommunism. ultimately talking abt why I never adopted their positions due to their chronically online character, "tiktokite", fascist, tendencies, holding of reactionary positions (national liberation), having no real world movement, ideology shoppers, and being comprised nearly entirely of firstly "first world" and secondly white people."</p>


                <p class="headingText"><b>Subject 3 - "Why "Left Communism" and Its Online Supporters Must be Opposed"</b></p>
                    <p>"based on the points discussed above, explaining why left communism generally and online particularly should and must be opposed by any upright student of marxism."</p>

                <p class="headingText"><b>Misc Notes</b></p>
                    <p>I suppose this doc requires an explanation. Essentially I'm writing this as an exposition of the online tendency of people turning leftcom my experience with that trend and how I nearly was swayed, at least in part, by their arguments.</p>

      <p class="headingText"><b>CRITICISMS AND SUGGESTIONS</b></p>
			  <p id="criticismsText">All critiques and suggestions can be directed to my email (AvawaveForward@proton.me) or my twitter (@AvawaveMaoism). I accept criticisms from all well meaning and serious people, only through struggle can higher understanding be developed.</p>
