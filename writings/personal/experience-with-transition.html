			<p class="writingsTitleText"><b>Current Title: "My Experience With Transition Thus Far and Overall"</b><p>
			
	            <p class="headingText"><b>Subject 1 - "General Timeline of Events"</b></p>
                    <p>This is another personal doc so here's what I wrote in the outline:</p>
                    <p>"outlining the general timeline of events, from explaining how my transition was first intiated thru an unconscious form against my burgeoning adrogenization via my intial reactionary masculine puberty, followed by the increasing way in which the anti-parental struggle played a central role as masculinzation was forced along inspite of my growing resistance to it, and finally explaining how my transition began in fall 2023 mainly thru the lens of very primitive struggle against the boymode mentally and accepting my feminine aspects and recognizing the desire to develop them further. Explaining, not in in depth detail, the successive triumphs of transition in 2024 until the catastrophe, followed by the long struggle to regain my previous position and attain hrt ultimately triumphing in February 2025, and then glossing over quickly the events which occured between then and now. (again all this relatively brief, perhaps in bullet points)"</p>

                <p class="headingText"><b>Subject 2 - "Hardships and Suffering"</b></p>
                    <p>"describing the hardships I've faced in my transition particularly in relation to the reactionary counter offensive of April 21st which nearly lead to my death and the liquidation of my transition. elaborating on social isolation and ineptitude which has made all my progressions immensely more difficult. overall emphasizing the role and utility of marxism-leninism-maoism in this process"</p>

                <p class="headingText"><b>Subject 3 - "Triumphs and Joy"</b></p>
                    <p>"talking about the small secondary triumphs in 2024 and the 3 great primary triumphs of February 2025, October 2025, and January 2026, again emphasizing the role and utility of marxism-leninism-maoism in the entire process"</p>

                <p class="headingText"><b>Subject 4 - "An Eye Forever Toward The Future"</b></p>
                    <p>"talking about how my transition finally galvinized me toward becoming a *student* of marxism-leninism-maoism, principally maoism, by way of oppression and the need to figure out how to surmount said oppression. and talking about where I see my transition going into the future from the current state."</p>

                <p class="headingText"><b>Misc Notes</b></p>
                    <p>this is another doc which I'm intending to be an extension to my "marxism applied to transition" series. This one describing my overall experience with transition, all its ups and downs (thus far), and my personal outlook on my personal situation, contrasting to the more general tone of the series.</p>

      <p class="headingText"><b>CRITICISMS AND SUGGESTIONS</b></p>
			  <p id="criticismsText">All critiques and suggestions can be directed to my email (AvawaveForward@proton.me) or my twitter (@AvawaveMaoism). I accept criticisms from all well meaning and serious people, only through struggle can higher understanding be developed.</p>
