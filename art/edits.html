                    </video>
                    <p>pls (pls pls) feel <b>VERY</b> free to spread this video around as you please. I spent a lot of time working on it and it would be a shame if no one actually saw it.</p>
      
                <p class="headingText">Meaning</p>
                    <p>I made this edit primarily as an agitation piece, especially for western <i>online</i> marxists. Aside from the intended purpose, the structure of the edit is very intentional. It starts off with footage of past revolutions, progressing from the russian revolution and ending with the GPCR. Then it moves on to more modern revolutions, linked by a quick clip of the collapse of the USSR, showing footage of people's wars going on (or have recently gone on in the case of Peru and Nepal). I did forget to include footage of TKP/ML but by the time I had realized that I was mostly done with that part of the edit. Then there is a brief section of different Marxists from Marx to modern/recent Marxist-Leninist-Maoists and communists flags, again in chronilogical order, and some modern actions to make up for the fact that I ran out of other images. That functioned to link into the final part with modern actions, mostly in germany lol I couldn't find any other footage of maoists in the modern day. Then there was a part at the very end with interchanging oppressing and oppressor nation footage which is meant to communicate how our struggles compliment each other. Then the very last part is self explanatory in what it says, just words of encouragement to go take action, if they didn't get the message from the rest of the video.</p>
        
                <p class="headingText">Other Thoughts</p>
                    <p>I think the biggest lesson from making this was that edits should be short and sweet usually. I think I did a good job mostly here but editing this all out took ages (a month of on and off work) and caused me wayyyy more stress than was necessary. If I ever make any other such edits in the future, which I probably will, I'll make sure production on it is my primary task so I'm not constantly stressing over finishing it while I have other very important things to do (my autistic mono tasking is a major pain in the ass).</p>
                    <p>Also if you want an alternative extended version of the edit with the extra cut up clips I didn't use (cutting up the clips was by far the most annoying part of editing so I figured it would be useful for other people to have access to a selection of good clips) or if you want all the links to the videos I used in the edit. Pls email me!!! My email is AvawaveForward@proton.me, I can send you whatever you need, or at least try and figure out how.</p>
